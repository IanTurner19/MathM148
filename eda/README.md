The first part of this notebook shows how there is very little change over time in the Ticketmaster data from different snapshots. The second part of this notebook uses whole_quarter.csv, which contains only one snapshot, and visualizes it in various ways. The 3rd part of this notebook visualizes a separate dataset from Kaggle containing data on Spotify artists.
