# Map-based EDA

map.ipynb contains the code to generate a map of the concerts across the USA using the python folium package. The map can be viewed at https://sites.google.com/view/ticketpricemap . The price of concerts and the genre of concerts were plotted over a map of the USA, and there was no state-scale geographic trend in this data. map_source.csv was obtained from Ticketmaster by keeping the    
    "MIN_PRICE",
    "MAX_PRICE",
    "CLASSIFICATION_GENRE",
    "VENUE_LATITUDE",
    "VENUE_LONGITUDE"
columns.
